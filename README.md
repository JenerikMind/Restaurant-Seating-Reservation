# Thinkful Reservations
 A simple implementation of basic seating reservations for front of the house purposes.  
 
 User can create reservations from AM til' 1hr before closing time.  
 User will be able to check guests in for reservation and can change status to "seated" when a table opens
 Guest will be linked to table until "finished" (also controlled by user)
 
 Default day off for hypothetical restaurant is on Tuesday so user will be unable to make reservations for then
